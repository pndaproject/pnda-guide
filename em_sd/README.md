# Endpoint Management and Service discovery

The Endpoint Management and Service discovery aims to solve these problems:

* /etc/hosts inflexible to changes and integration with external discovery
* Endpoints change over time but nothing updates them
* Hand rolled implementation for endpoint registrar (on DM)
* Configuration inflexibly handled as multiple config files on various nodes

See the following pages for a description of features available on other tabs:
 * [Consul basis](consul.md)
 * [DNS in PNDA](dns.md)
 * [Service discovery](sd.md)
