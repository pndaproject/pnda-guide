# PNDA Components

PNDA has a number of components, some of which are built from PNDA source repositories and others which are obtained from online repositories. All of these components must be staged on a suitable HTTP server prior to provisioning a cluster in your target environment.

For full instructions on creating PNDA and advice on staging the PNDA components, please refer the [repository notes](https://github.com/pndaproject/pnda/blob/master/build/README.md).
