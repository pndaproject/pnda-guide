# Getting started with SaltStack

PNDA uses SaltStack for deployment automation. A good place to start is the [SaltStack Get Started Guide](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/getstarted/). Here you will learn the fundamentals of SaltStack.

Next, read about the [SaltStack Components](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/getstarted/overview.html) that form the basis of Salt: the Salt Master, the [minions](http://img0.ndsstatic.com/wallpapers/c42ac6a0c2aaee69c79955d1d32c54b4_large.jpeg) that receive commands from the master, modules, formulas, grains and more.

Once you've understood the principles, you could then go to the [SaltStack walk-through](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/tutorials/walkthrough.html) where you will install Salt and can begin experimenting with it.

As an alternative to installing software locally, it is possible to use the [SaltStack Demo Environment](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/getstarted/fundamentals/index.html), which leverages VirtualBox and Vagrant. In less than an hour you can be up and ready to go!
